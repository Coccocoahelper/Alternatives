## Replace

* [Canalex's Keystrokes with Polyfrost's Revamp](https://modrinth.com/mod/keystrokes)
    * Canalex's keystrokes are old and no longer maintained. Polyfrost's revamp will continue to receive updates.
* [Spiderfrog's old animations with Polyfrost's OverflowAnimationsV2](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OverflowAnimationsV2/releases/latest)
    * Spiderfrog's OAM causes many issues with other mods, is bloated, and causes crashes. Polyfrost's is more accurate to 1.7 with better compatibility and no bloat, along with even more features and animations missing from Spiderfrog's.
* [Powns' ToggleSneak with Lily & Polyfrost's PolySprint](https://github.com/Polyfrost/PolySprint/releases/latest)
    * Powns' ToggleSneak is no longer maintained and has some small issues that Polyfrost's fixes.
* [SkyWars Stats mod with HyStats](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/796895966414110751/1062109449810092142/HyStats-v4.0_1.8.9.jar)
    * KAD7's more recent HyStats now supports multiple game-modes and has much more to offer compared to the discontinued SkyWars Stats mod.
* [Pown's Potion Effect HUD with Tellinq's Potion Effects](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009757412921708604/1134270520876073031/Potion_Effects_1.8.9-forge-1.0-beta-3.jar)
    * Powns's mods are no longer maintained.

    * Powns's mods are no longer maintained.
* [Powns's Armor Status HUD with isXander's EvergreenHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/evergreenhud)
    * Powns's mods are no longer maintained.

## Remove

* ModCore Container
    * ModCore Container was a mod meant to give players ModCore before it was packaged in mods that needed it, therefore making ModCore Container no longer in use. ModCore has also now been superseded by Essential.
* Player API
    * Player API is no longer used in any mods.
* AutoWho
    * Hypixel removed AutoWho's core functionality a few years ago.
* PerspectiveMod
    * PerspectiveMod is now **bannable** on Hypixel.
* ChatTriggers (ctjs)
    * ChatTriggers may cause many performance issues depending on your modules and most of the modules you can get are readily available in other mods. Many people also do not know how to use ChatTriggers and never import any modules, leading to an increased startup time for no reason.
* [SkyblockAddons](https://alternatives.microcontrollers.dev/1.8.9/skyblockaddons)
    * SkyblockAddons is old, unmaintained, and has many features that are either useless or simply do not work anymore. It will cause issues on Skyblock.
* [Skypixel](https://alternatives.microcontrollers.dev/1.8.9/skypixel)
    * Skypixel is old, unmaintained, and has many features that are either useless or simply do not work anymore. It will cause issues on Skyblock.
* [LabyMod](https://alternatives.microcontrollers.dev/1.8.9/labymod)
    * LabyMod causes many issues with other mods, has performance issues, and has many alternatives that can be used without messing up other mods.
* [SkyblockExtras](https://alternatives.microcontrollers.dev/1.8.9/skyblockextras) (if you bought it)
    * SBE breaks EULA, breaks some other mod licenses, leads to performance issues, and has much better free alternatives for all of its important features.
